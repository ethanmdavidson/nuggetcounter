# nuggetcounter

We've all been there: You and your friends are trying to see if y'all can eat 2000 [chicken nuggets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burger_King_chicken_nuggets), but you have no way to track how many nuggets you've eaten! You could use pen and paper, but then your friends in Los Angeliss and Milwarkee can't participate! You could use an online spreadsheet, but boy oh boy that's a HASSLE! What are you going to do?!???????!

Worry no longer, becase the nuggetcounter is here. Just go to the nuggetcounter website (coming soon), enter a team name and a username, and then track those delicious nugs with just one tap of your greasy finger.

This app includes the following STATE OF THE ART features:
 - ~~laziness~~ minimalism!
 - blockchain!
 - hot hot hot chiken nuggers !
 - a profound sense of regret!
 -  ...and more! 
 
 Follow me as we dive into a mechanically-separated world full of bells and boots, where gastroinstestinal perforation lurks around every corner. Just remember: [the impossible is possible if you believe the impossible is possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGWEa3mDFqw).
